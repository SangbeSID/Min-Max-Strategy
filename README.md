# Min-Max Strategy

Use the min-max Strategy to build the game of Marienbad.
<br/>
This game was build in Ocaml using only <strong>recursion function</strong>,
<strong> tree algorithms </strong> and <strong>conditional structures</strong> (if then else).
<br/>
I invite you to try the game, the computer is an awesome player.
